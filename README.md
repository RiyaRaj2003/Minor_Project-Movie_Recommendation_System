# Movie Recommendation System using KNN Algorithm and Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search

This project is solely based on research work.

## Research Faculty

This project, supervised by `Dr. Bhabani Shankar Prasad Mishra`, Dean of Academics at KIIT University (Bhubaneswar) was completed in a team of four over four months (Feb 2024 - May 2024) during our 6th semester.

## About the Project

### `Abstract` 

The Movie Recommendation System report is centred around analyzing user-item interaction data for personalized movie recommendations using the KNN Algorithm and Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search optimization. By leveraging machine learning techniques our approach aims to elevate user satisfaction by providing tailored movie
recommendations, enriching the entertainment consumption experience. 

### `Individual contribution and findings`

In the Movie Recommendation System project, my primary responsibility was to conduct a comprehensive in-depth research analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses in existing methodologies. My contributions included integrating state-of-the-art techniques to address these limitations effectively. I evaluated model performance using various metrics such as precision and recall.\
Additionally, I conducted a thorough literature review and research gap, by examining numerous movie recommendation projects from 2017 to 2024. This extensive research
enabled me to identify common limitations in existing systems and develop innovative solutions to overcome these challenges. 

### `Individual contribution to project report preparation`

Contributed to researching, writing, gathering and compiling data on research gaps, UML diagrams, result analysis sections, and evaluation ensuring comprehensive coverage and clarity in the project report. 

### `Individual contribution to project presentation and demonstration`

Orchestrated the structuring and formatting of the report, ensuring a professional presentation of our research findings, methodologies and results.

### `Takeaway`

Gained practical experience in advanced AI/ML methodologies and collaborative system design by developing a recommendation system that tracks user search patterns and delivers tailored recommendations.
